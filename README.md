**STRUCTURAL TOPIC MODEL (STM):**
Topic modeling is finding out the topics in a document. Topic modeling follows unsupervised learning. Grouping of similar topics within a document are done. K number of topics is generated. K is a set value and it can be modified. So, preferable number of topics can be generated. The top words in each topic will be generated. N top words in each topic are generated. N is also set. The words with their corresponding probability in the document is generated. Each topic proportion in the document is also obtained. Topic Modeling helps in document clustering, document summary and other related applications.
