**STRUCTURAL TOPIC MODEL (STM):**
Topic modeling is finding out the topics in a document. Topic modeling follows unsupervised learning. The topics within a document are filtered and clustered. K number of topics is generated. K is a set value and it can be modified. So, preferable number of topics will be generated. The top words in each topic will be generated. N top words in each topic are generated. N is also set. The words with their corresponding probability in the document is generated. Topic Modeling helps in document clustering, document summary and other related applications.
